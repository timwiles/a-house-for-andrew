David (my contact in the village) has negotiated
with the local engineer and secured a quote
for building the house. 

Below is a Google Sheet showing the items that remain to be donated by someone.

The breakdown comes to slightly more than the 
10M Ugandan shillings specified at the start of
the fundraising, and I've updated the GoFundMe target
(2000GBP -> 2500GBP) accordingly.
