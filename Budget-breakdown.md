# Budget breakdown - 2020-06-28

**Updated Sun 28 June 2020 06:05 BST**

David (my contact in the village) has sent me 
a budget breakdown for the house for "Andrew", having discussed with the
 local engineer. 

The breakdown comes to more than the budget of
10M Ugandan shillings specified at the start of
the fundraising. I'm discussing with David today
whether to increase the GoFundMe target
(2000GBP -> 2900GBP) or whether we can simplify the
house and still build it within the budget. 

When we have finished discussing, I will post
the breakdown here.
