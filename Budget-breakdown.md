# Budget breakdown - 2020-06-30

**Updated Tue 30 June 2020 07:05 BST**

David (my contact in the village) has negotiated
with the local engineer and secured a quote
for building the house. 

[Budget breakdown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0_5IoKHOs6oxn-PAll0rTl7PZoU1SvLJSLwZ8Cx10E) 

The breakdown comes to slightly more than the 
10M Ugandan shillings specified at the start of
the fundraising, and I've updated the GoFundMe target
(2000GBP -> 2500GBP) accordingly. 

If you have any more questions you'd like to ask
me or David then please don't hesitate to contact
