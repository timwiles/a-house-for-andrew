David (my contact in the village) has negotiated
with the local engineer and secured a quote
for building the house.

The breakdown comes to slightly more than the 
10M Ugandan shillings specified at the start of
the fundraising, and I've updated the GoFundMe target
(2000GBP -> 2500GBP) accordingly. 

If you have any more questions you'd like to ask
me or David then please don't hesitate to contact
