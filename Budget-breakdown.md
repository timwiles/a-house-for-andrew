# Budget breakdown - 2020-06-30

**Updated Tue 30 June 2020 07:05 BST**

David (my contact in the village) has sent me 
a budget breakdown for the house for "Andrew", having discussed with the
 local engineer. 

The breakdown comes to slightly more than the budget of
10M Ugandan shillings specified at the start of
the fundraising. I've updated the GoFundMe target
(2000GBP -> 2500GBP) accordingly. But still an
excellent price for a house. David managed
to negotiate well with the engineer.
