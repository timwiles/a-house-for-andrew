# Latest sub-project - End period poverty in Eastern Uganda 

In Eastern Uganda, many women and schoolgirls can go for months without access to sanitary products of any kind. Emergency supplies can be given in extreme circumstances, but this is not a long-term solution.

However, when given a little training and equipment, we are showing that women in Eastern Uganda are capable of educating their communities in reproductive health issues, and even manufacturing their own sanitary products in a safe, sustainable manner.

This development work could not come at a better time for this area - The strict coronavirus
lockdown in Uganda has led to many losing their jobs.

# Previous Sub-Projects

## A house for John

*September 2020 -- December 2020*

David and I began our work together in April 2020. At the time, the harsh economic situation caused by the strict coronavirus lockdown in Uganda was causing many rural communities to lose hope for the future.

Our plan was to raise funds in the UK and use them to employ local construction workers in Uganda to build a house for an elderly man called Arthur suffering from diabetes.

Arthur died before we could begin construction, so (having informed the donors) we used the money to build a house for an HIV patient called John.

All the money left over from the House for John sub-project has been carried over to the End Period Poverty sub-project.
