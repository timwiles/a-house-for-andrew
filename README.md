# Latest sub-project - End period poverty in Eastern Uganda 

In Eastern Uganda, many women and schoolgirls can go for months without access to sanitary products of any kind. 

When given the right training and equipment, we are showing that women in Eastern Uganda are capable of manufacturing their own sanitary products in a safe, sustainable manner.

# Previous Sub-Projects

## A house for John

*September 2020 -- December 2020*

David and I began our work together in April 2020. At the time, the harsh economic situation caused by the strict coronavirus lockdown in Uganda was causing many rural communities to lose hope for the future.

Our plan was to raise funds in the UK and use them to employ local construction workers in Uganda to build a house for an elderly man called Arthur suffering from diabetes.

Arthur died before we could begin construction, so (having informed the donors) we used the money to build a house for an HIV patient called John.

All the money left over from the House for John sub-project has been carried over to the End Period Poverty sub-project.
