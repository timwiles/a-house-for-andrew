# Latest Sub-Project - Ending period poverty in Eastern Uganda 

In Eastern Uganda, many women and schoolgirls can go for months without access to sanitary products of any kind. Emergency supplies can be given in extreme circumstances, but this is not a long-term solution.

However, when given a little training and equipment, we are showing that women in Eastern Uganda are capable of educating their communities in reproductive health issues, and even manufacture their own sanitary products in a safe, sustainable manner.

See the project page for more.Â 

# What happened to the original project?

You may recall that the project was initially titled "A house for Arthur before the rains come". The 
beneficiary of this project was an elderly diabetes patient living in Peta. Following Arthur's 
death in mid-2020 (whilst funds were still being collected) the decision was made to repurpose the
project to care for others in the community of Peta who were victims of poverty and disease.

This aid and development work could not come at a better time for this community - The strict coronavirus
lockdown in Uganda has led to many losing their jobs. In addition, the travel restrictions have
caused equally many to be without access to medical care.
