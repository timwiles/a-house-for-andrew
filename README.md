Dear supporters,

It is with a heavy heart that I announce that the "house for Arthur" building project is going to be repurposed. The reason is that the man in question (Arthur, although his real name was Alfred) passed away in mid-2020. 

His death was unexpected and early. Sadly it has
become characteristic of the coronavirus lockdown 
in rural Uganda.

no relatives. And so the charity have advised me
that I should (with permission from my supporters
use the money that has been donated so far to
help individuals in the village with basic needs
and prevent further early
deaths.

could construct Arthur a concrete house
where he could live out his old age. 

This was sadly not to be,  as Arthur died a few months
later. 

However, the project had an unexpected 
side-effect: exposing the extreme poverty
and the lack of
