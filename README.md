This should be quite a fun project. 

This elderly man in rural Uganda is living in a hut which is leaking rather drastically. His wife and son (who would be helping him otherwise) have both died and are buried in his garden. 

Luckily his village (Peta) happens to be round the corner from an international charity run by a friend of mine. Not only that, but his fellow villagers (who brought his situation to my attention)  have pledged to do the building work if I can provide the materials.

## Project Assessment 

I've done building projects like this before and they are very rewarding. Photos will be made available throughout the work. In addition, the international charity [Knowledge Facilitators International](https://www.knowledgefacilitators.org/) has offered to send someone round to offer any assistance the villagers need.
