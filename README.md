Dear supporters,

It is with a heavy heart that I announce that the "house for Arthur" building project is going to be **repurposed**. The reason is that the man in question (Arthur) has passed away.

However, there are a 
number of other individuals in the same village who are experiencing
extreme poverty, and our task is now to work out how we can best 
prevent them from suffering early demise.

The project has thus been retitled as **helping those in extreme poverty  in Peta**.

## Charity visit to the village (18 Sep 2020)

Arthur's death in mid-2020 was unexpected and early. Sadly, it has
become characteristic of the coronavirus lockdown 
in rural Uganda.

A worker from the [development charity 
Knofacic](https://www.knowledgefacilitators.org/)   visited
the village as my representative on Friday 
18 Sep 2020. He took some pictures of the village 
and of Arthur's grave, as you can see 
in the [photo gallery](Photo-gallery.md) (I was unaware that Arthur had died until this visit).

The charity worker did an excellent job of finding out the full story
and observing the needs of the community. He discussed the situation with my contact David, and identified a number of other individuals who are also experiencing
extreme poverty. Arthur leaves behind
no relatives that we know of. And so the charity have advised me
that I should (with permission from my supporters)
use the money that has been donated so far to
help individuals in the village with basic needs
and prevent further early
deaths.  


## How can we help? 

Fortunately, a little goes a long way in 
rural communities, and the money that
has been donated so far will be plenty
enough to provide for at least two households. Knofacic have 
offered to deliver the money directly to those in need.

## More about the village of Peta and the region of Turoro

David and his community in the village of Peta 
have been known to myself since 2017, and
to Knofacic far longer. 

David brought Arthur's situation to my
attention in May 2020. He didn't realise
the seriousness of Arthur's poverty and
health condition (diabetes), and so had the idea that we
could construct Arthur a concrete house
where he could live out his old age. 

This was sadly not to be,  as Arthur died soon afterwards.

However, the project had an unexpected 
side-effect: exposing the extreme poverty
and the lack of medical care that has arisen in Peta as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. 


## More about Arthur (Alfred) and his life

"Arthur"  (whose real name was Alfred) grew up Western Uganda. People from this region tend to be nomadic herdspeople.

He came to the village of Peta (in Eastern Uganda) in the mid-1980s, when he was around 30 years old. He worked keeping the
cattle for a local family, and became known to the whole community. He became romantically involved with a local woman, and they had a son together.
However, the woman and the son died, leaving Alfred living alone and in serious poverty in his old age. In 2020, he himself then died at the age of 70 from diabetes, whilst the villagers
of Peta were still in the process of raising funds to build him a semi-permanent house to replace his mud hut.
