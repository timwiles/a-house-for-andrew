# Project outline 

In Eastern Uganda, many women and schoolgirls use disposable sanitary products. However, due to financial insecurity, many experience months where they cannot afford such products at all.

This leaves women in sensitive "period poverty" situations which they then struggle to communicate to their friends and colleagues. 

My contacts in Uganda have identified 3 villages that could benefit from:

1. Training and equipment necessary for manufacturing *washable* sanitary towels.

2. A school-based reproductive health training scheme


The washable towels are ideally suited to rural areas as they rely less heavily on imports.

The international development charity [Knofu](https://knowledge-facilitators.org) (formerly known as Knofacic) have started recruiting community members in each of the 3 schools to deliver the training.

We believe that (by the grace of God) we will be able to directly impact the lives of 500 girls, and move towards ending period poverty in Uganda.

# Fundraising 

I've created a [new GoFundMe page]() for handling donations.

100% of the funds raised will be used to employ local Knofu workers in the target communities, and to purchase materials.

<footer>I absorb overheads (debit and credit card transaction fees) myself using a separate bank account. Please [email me](mailto:tcwiles@gmail.com) if you'd like to contribute to this fund.</footer>

I'll post details and photos here as usual. 

# Pilot session

Knofu employees ran a pilot training session in the school in Peta in January 2021. See the [Photo Gallery](Photo-Gallery.md). The session was a huge success, with male community members commenting "i will definitely help my family members when they come to me in need of pads in the future".
