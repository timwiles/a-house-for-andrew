Below is a summary of the work carried out using the first 1750 GBP
of the donation money.

After meetings between David (our contact in the village) and 
the Knofacic workers, one family was identified who could
benefit most from the development work.

John (not his real name) is a 56-year-old AIDS patient living in the region of Peta.
Having been introduced to him by our contacts in the village, 
Knofacic learned that he is self skilled in tailoring, and strong enough to have his own
tailoring business if provided with a machine.

John is single after his wife left him 10 years ago. He has 2 boys (aged 18 & 14yrs)
and has 1 married girl aged 22 yrs.

After discussions between the charity workers and David, the decision was made to build a new house for
John, and to purchase a sewing machine to help him get started in business.

## Initial funds transfer - 2020-10-10

The first 1000 GBP donated money was transferred by Knofacic staff to Uganda by bank transfer
with UK government gift-aid added on. Construction began on 12 October 2020.

## Third funding transfer - (planned for 2020-11-27)

John's new home is now complete. Our plan is now to buy a sewing machine for him (he is a skilled
tailor) using the next round of funding. We have also identified another family in the village, and will begin 
working with them soon as-and-when funding becomes available.
