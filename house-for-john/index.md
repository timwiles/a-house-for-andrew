# Sub-project 1 - A house for John

**Last update - 2020-11-09**

Below is a summary of the work carried out using the first 1750 GBP
of the donation money.

After meetings between David (our contact in the village) and 
the Knofacic workers, one family was identified who could
benefit most from the development work.

John (not his real name) is a 56-year-old AIDS patient living in the region of Peta.
Having been introduced to him by our contacts in the village, 
Knofacic learned that he is self skilled in tailoring, and strong enough to have his own
tailoring business if provided with a machine.

John is single after his wife left him 10 years ago. He has 2 boys (aged 18 & 14yrs)
and has 1 married girl aged 22 yrs.

After discussions between the charity workers and David, the decision was made to build a new house for
John, and to purchase a sewing machine to help him get started in business.

## Second funding transfer - 2020-10-20

A second installment of funding (this time 750 GBP) was sent on 2020-10-20, as the structure of the house was 
nearing completion. Painting has now commenced.  The next stage is to purchase bedding, etc.

More photos coming soon.

John will move into his new home as soon as it is safe and ready.
